# Webpage that I Love
This is a webpage that I find interesting regarding software development [p5js](https://p5js.org/).

This library is created here **CMU**. One professor that was in part of the development process is in **NYU Tisch** (I believe...), and he has a youtube channel that I LOVE called _Coding Train_.

This library helps students in art major, or any non technical major to use graphic design to assist webpage implemenetation.

 This is a really good website introducing tons of useful tools for Javascript. Everyone can read the instructions and learn how to leverage these libraries.

I love using p5js! I have used it in a bunch of projects and it is a lot of fun to play around with. I didn't know that it was created by an NYU professor-- that's very cool! 

I love this tool
